# Human.Net – MVP Milestones Summary

| Milestone | Title | Focus | Proven Capability | Exit Proof |
|------------|--------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **M1** | Identity & Vault | Local identity & sovereignty | L1 DIDs, encrypted vault, LAN discovery | Two peers exchange signed presence pings. |
| **M2** | Docs & Policies | Data ownership & governance | Signed docs, deterministic policy, local views | Folder import → folder@1 created → deterministic replay. |
| **M3** | Trust & Exchange | Verified identity & contracts | L2 verification, offer/contract chain, shard publishing | Verified peers exchange encrypted data via contract. |
| **M4** | Discovery & Agency | Global discovery & AI assistance | view@1, materialization receipts, assistant compilation | “Find Anna’s Rome pictures” → verified result & contract. |

## Supporting Artifacts by Milestone

**M1 – Identity & Vault**
- `id@1`, `policy.json`, vault schema, LAN presence.

**M2 – Docs & Policies**
- `doc@1` (file/folder/note), `policy@1`, view local evaluator.

**M3 – Trust & Exchange**
- `offer@1`, `contract@1`, `rep@1`, shard sync & revocation.

**M4 – Discovery & Agency**
- `view@1`, `materialization@1`, `assistant@1`, MCP prototype.

## Milestone Integrity Tests

| Test | Verified In |
|------|--------------|
| Deterministic policy replay | M2 |
| Contract encryption & expiry | M3 |
| View determinism & proof verification | M4 |
| Assistant consent enforcement | M4 |

---

## Sequence Logic
1. **M1** proves self-sovereignty.  
2. **M2** proves ownership of data.  
3. **M3** proves trust between peers.  
4. **M4** proves discovery and AI mediation.  

After M4, Human.Net demonstrates the **complete human–data–trust–agent loop**.
