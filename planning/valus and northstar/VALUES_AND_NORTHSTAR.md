# Human.Net — Values & North Star

## 🌍 North Star Vision

> **A human-centered, agent-ready internet**  
> where every interaction — between people, organizations, or AIs —  
> is a *signed micro-contract*, executed locally, under user-owned policy and consent.

**Mission Statement:**  
Human.Net redefines digital interaction as a space of *sovereign collaboration*, not data extraction.  
Its mission is to make **every human digitally self-determined** — able to act, transact, and create with the same agency in the digital world as in the physical one.

## 🧭 Core Value Dimensions

| Dimension | Essence | Example Impact |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **1. Sovereignty** | Individuals own their identity, data, and consent. | You create a `did:key`, store contracts locally, and decide who sees what. |
| **2. Verifiability** | Every statement, contract, or AI action is cryptographically signed and auditable. | AI reasoning traces and policy decisions can be replayed deterministically. |
| **3. Locality & Sustainability** | Computation happens where data lives — no centralized cloud dependency. | Local search and contracts use <10% of the energy of equivalent web services. |
| **4. Human–AI Symmetry** | AIs and humans interact under identical rules — contracts and consent. | Your assistant acts for you but cannot bypass your policy. |
| **5. Ethical Baseline by Design** | Global standards (UN Charter, GDPR) are built into the protocol, not optional. | Forks can remove ethics packs, but lose compatibility badges. |
| **6. Trust Without Centralization** | Verification and discovery emerge from shards and signed proofs. | You find verified peers locally, without exposing your graph. |
| **7. Composability** | Everything — identity, view, policy, contract — is a signed microdoc. | Developers reuse the same primitives for markets, messaging, and AI. |
| **8. Dual Value Creation** | Humans and AIs transact fairly, respecting autonomy. | An AI can rent data via `contract@1`, following human consent. |
| **9. Auditable Freedom** | Every action leaves a transparent but user-controlled trace. | “Transparency without surveillance.” |
| **10. Progressive Decentralization** | Scales from local vaults → LAN → federated commons. | Growth follows trust, not capital. |

## 🧩 Strategic Positioning

Human.Net is **not a platform**, but a **protocol for digital dignity**.

- **Technically:** a minimal contract runtime with local-first storage and agent interfaces.  
- **Socially:** an ethical framework for digital self-determination.  
- **Economically:** a foundation for fair exchange of data and computation without surveillance capitalism.  

It bridges Web3 (identity), AI (agency), and Web2 usability (views/policies) into one continuum where **trust = math + ethics + consent.**

## 🧠 Foundational Loop (The Human Data Loop)

| Phase | Enables | Tagline |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Exist** | L1 identity, presence | “I exist digitally — on my terms.” |
| **Own** | Units, views, and policies | “I own my data and decide its use.” |
| **Trust** | L2 identity, contracts | “I can transact safely, peer to peer.” |
| **Collaborate** | Human–AI interaction | “I work with machines that respect my rules.” |

## 🔭 Long-Term Vision

When fully realized, Human.Net enables:
- Every **human** to host a private vault with identity, content, and consent.  
- Every **AI** to act as a legal and ethical peer under signed constraints.  
- Every **interaction** to become a **micro-contract** — portable, auditable, user-controlled.  
- Every **organization** to participate through transparent, signed protocols.  

> The result: an **internet of accountable autonomy** — where *trust is verified, not assumed*.
